# Virtual Assistant

## Project Title
Virtual Assistant

## Project Description
Virtual Assistant is a Python-based project designed to automate simple tasks and interactions within a personal computing environment. The assistant is capable of performing a variety of commands upon voice or text input, including searching the web, playing YouTube videos, taking screenshots, controlling volume, and managing the computer's power state.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to explore the capabilities of combining speech recognition, text processing, and system interaction to create a practical and interactive tool that can simplify everyday tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core scripting language for the project.
- **SpeechRecognition**: A library for performing speech recognition, converting speech into text.
- **pyttsx3**: A text-to-speech conversion library.
- **pywhatkit**: A utility for interacting with YouTube and performing web searches.
- **pyautogui**: A module for automating GUI interactions, such as taking screenshots and controlling volume.
- **os**: A module for interacting with the operating system, including executing system commands.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Listen and interpret voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provide spoken feedback for executed commands.
- **Web Search**: Perform basic web searches using `pywhatkit`.
- **YouTube Search**: Play videos from YouTube based on search terms.
- **Screenshot**: Capture screenshots of the screen.
- **Volume Control**: Increase or decrease system volume.
- **Power Management**: Put the computer to sleep, shut down, or restart the system.

## Challenges and Future Enhancements
- Enhancing the natural language understanding to better interpret complex commands.
- Integrating more advanced features such as scheduling reminders or managing calendar events.
- Improving the user interface for better visual feedback and command input.

# BMI Calculator

Welcome to the BMI Calculator! This simple Python script helps you calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your weight and height.

## How It Works

1. Run the script and enter your weight in kilograms and height in meters when prompted.
2. The script checks if the inputs are valid (positive real numbers).
3. It calculates your BMI using the standard formula.
4. The script determines your BMI category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).
5. Finally, it displays your BMI and category in an easy-to-understand format.

## Quick Start

To use the BMI Calculator, simply execute the `bmi_calculator.py` script in your Python environment.

## Note

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If you encounter any issues, check the input values and try again.
