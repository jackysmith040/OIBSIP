IDEA: random password generator


OVERVIEW:
    - generates random passwords based on certain criteria.
    Criteria:
        - length of password
        - character types that is whether the user wants letters only, numbers only, symbols only or a mixture
    - So basically the user decides what the password should be made of


THOUGHT PROCESS:

    Inputs:
        - length of password
        - character types ie. letters, numbers, symbols

        ~ Error handling:
            - length must be a positive integer.
            - the character types should be in lower case
            - the user should be given another chance to correct the error until the user meets the error-free requirements above

    Logical Part:
        password output:
            - can include capital letters

        character types:
            - if the user doesnt specify anything the password should just generate the random password including all the datatypes.
            - if the user types 'all' it should also just generate the random password including all the datatypes.
            - the character type that the user would specify would be excluded when generating the password. 
            ie. not be displayed when generating the random password

            Example:
                Sample Scenerios:
                    1:
                        - length: 8
                        - exclude: no input or 'all'
                        - password -> qenW12#$
                    2:
                        - length: 8
                        - exclude:'letters'
                        - password -> 65#?12#$
                    3:
                        - length: 5
                        - exclude: 'symbols'
                        - password -> iu23H
                    4:
                        - length: 10
                        - exclude: 'numbers symbols'
                        - password -> uKwjSNdpoL
    Output:
       ' ______________________PASSWORD GENERATOR________________________________'

       ' Please enter the length:'
        'What should I exclude? :'

        'Password --->' `random password`



GENERAL PLAN:

    Variables:
    - password_length: integer 
    - exclude_type: string
    - passcode: string

    Specifics:
        - password_length | should positive
        - exclude_type | should lower cased when being inputted
        - passcode | the final output that contains the random password

- Ask the user for their password_length and exclude_type
- make sure the `Variables` are in their right data type and `Specifics`

~ Error handling:
    - length must be a positive integer.
    - the character types should be in lower case
    - the user should be given another chance to correct the error until the user meets the error-free requirements above



-- function 
    exclude_types(exclude_type):
        comment:
            | Excludes the character type as specified in the parameter.
    
        - if `exclude_type` has the words 'all' or is empty:
            - generate the randomly without removing anything
          else:
            - when combining the character types it makes sure to remove the `exclude_type` character type
        - endif
        - save the result in a `excluded` variable
        return `excluded`


    passcode_length(password_length):
        comment:
            | Makes sure the password has a specified length as contained in `passcode_length` parameter.
        
        - if password_length > 0:
            - for loop the same number times as the passcode_length:
                - temp_passcode = exclude_types(exclude_type)
                - passcode = passcode + temp_passcode
            - endfor
          else:
            - error message | a simple user friendly error message
        - endif

        return `passcode`

-- main function
    - Display:
        ' ______________________PASSWORD GENERATOR________________________________'

    - Ask the user for their password_length and exclude_type.
    - Format of Input:
        'Please enter the length:' | input for password_length
        'What should I exclude? :' | input for exclude_type

    - make sure the `Variables` are in their right data type and `Specifics`

    ~ Error handling:
        - length must be a positive integer.
        - the character types should be in lower case
        - the user should be given another chance to correct the error until the user meets the error-free requirements above

    - excluded =  exclude_types(exclude_type)
    - passcode = passcode_length(password_length)
    
    - Display:
        'Password --->' passcode
